# stat263-finalproject
Goal: Multiclass classification of ultrasound images into breast cancer diagnoses. 

Method: Convolutional Neural Network 

TODOs when cloning:  
* Create a venv and install everything in the requirements.txt. 
* I have set it up so that the image files don't push to the repo because they are too big, so you will need to run everything in the mileston_notebook.ipynb in order to get the data split up into test, training, val before moving onto creating a model
